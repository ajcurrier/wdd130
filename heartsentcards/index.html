        <h1>Happily Ever Greetings</h1>
        <p id="main-body">
            Our world needs kindness. There is so much conflict and sadness in our world today. What would be solved if we all shared more genuine care towards others? Every human being wants to feel loved and appreciated for the person they are inside. To know that they are valued. So what do we often do when we want to show that we value someone? We pick up a greeting card from the grocery store. But is the recipient left wondering how much we really meant the sweet, but mass-produced words or poems on the card?

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            Our mission is to present our customers with uniquely personal greeting cards that you won’t find in any old brick and mortar store. On this website you will have the opportunity to fill out a short survey where you will select the occasion and answer questions about the person you wish to send your card to. Based off your choices, the site will present you with card options that have meaning to the receiver. Their favorite team, favorite pastime, animal, color and more! Are they a die-hard patriot? We will create a card that features their country. This company is new, but one day we hope to get licenses from big companies like Disney, to include their characters on our cards.
            <h2>Just Ask</h2>
            Don’t know the answer to some of the questions? Just ask them! Send that random text. It will give you opportunities to get to know your friend better. You can save your survey and come back later. Then our mission will be doubly achieved when you get to know your friend better.
            <h2>Greeting Creation</h2>
            In a rush? You can skip any question and we will offer card suggestions based on what you do know. The survey will include an option to choose characteristics that you admire in them. You can pick from a list, or write them in yourself. You have the option to use our greeting generator, which will take the characteristics you sent and give you greeting options. Don’t worry, you will have the chance to edit the text before it’s done.
            <h2>How to get the card</h2>
            You can either order a digital card to download, print and assemble yourself using easy to follow instructions. You can find a list of recommended printer paper here. Or you can purchase the assembled card directly from us. We include an option to remove the receipt from the envelope so you can ship it straight to the receiver if you need to.
            <h2>What makes us special</h2>
            Our team includes a team of Graphic Designers and 3D card specialists who continue to add beautiful cards to our collection. We pride ourselves in the unique quality of our cards. Have a card suggestion? We would love to hear it! Please tell us by email.
