           <h2>Strengthen Friendships</h2>
            <p>A great way to get to know someone is to ask them thought-provoking questions and really listen to their answers. When they are talking, it is important that all your attention is on what they are saying. It’s easy to get distracted thinking about what you are going to ask next, but you may find that you miss parts of what they are saying and the chance for deep connection passes by. Focus on what they are saying and follow up questions may naturally come.<br>

                "A portion of my dissertation for my doctoral degree was spent researching listening. If you want to improve every relationship in your life, practice listening. I’ve heard it said, “What air is to the lungs, listening is to the soul.” With that in mind, some of your friends and family haven’t breathed in years. They need to be heard. Just listen to understand. Listen and try to see the world as they see it. <br>
                <br>By the way, set a timer. Men will listen better when they know when the listening is going to be over. They aren’t unloving or stupid, it’s just how their brain works.<br>
                <br>Just listen. It may be awkward at first. Your family may have not seen your eyes in a long time. However, I think you’ll find out the gift of listening is one of those priceless gifts that doesn’t cost you a cent. This is a present that requires you to be present."
