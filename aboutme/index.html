    <p>My name is Ashley. I am working towards getting my BS in applied Technology and Web Design certificates along the way.</p>
    <p>I enjoy gardening  and making things with my Silhouette Cameo. My Cameo is like a cricut, but better for print and cut and it does not require a subscription service; so it's a great match for me. I also love when I get to have quality bonding experiences with my daughter. Those moments don't come everyday but when they come they are special to me.</p>
    <p>I love to create on my computer. It's been a passion of mine since I was young. I chose Web Design because it seems like a great way to use the things I create and make a living off of it. I also hope to be able to work from home. I am thinking that some day I will make a web site to sell things I create.</p>
    <p>When I was young, I read a Learn HTML in 24 hours book (it took longer than 24 hours) and I took a  Dreamweaver class. I created a couple simple pages with that. I also learned a little adobe Flash. I decided that I really did not like it then. Dreamweaver CS3 was so buggy and frustrating. However, technology has come a long way since then and I may have been missing some important tips and tricks, since I was mostly self taught. I am sure I will like it more now.</p>
